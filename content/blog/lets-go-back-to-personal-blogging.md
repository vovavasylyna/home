Once upon a time, there were blogs - they were like the original social media. People built communities and fostered connections. They shared personal stuff a lot. They did this often. They looked out for any trouble and helped each other by sharing links to interesting blogs with newcomers.

The really good blogs gave us a peek into someone's life on the internet. Fun stories and chats in the comments alongside email exchange kept us coming back every day.

Don't we miss that?

We should all have our own little place on the internet. We should all be in control of our platforms and own our content. Having a personal blog is a nice way to do that.

So, grab that web name you like. Make your own space online. Tell your stories, find your community, and talk to your people. It doesn't have to be huge. It doesn't need lots of fancy stuff. You don't need to copy others. Actually, you shouldn't. This is about you. It's your thing. It should show who you are.

Let's bring back personal blogging in 2023.
