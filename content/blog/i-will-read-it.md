"I don't know what to write about" and "I'm afraid no one will read it". These are the two biggest roadblocks that prevent people from starting a personal blog. I've heard them all before, and I'm here to tell you that they're not real problems.

The first problem is easy to solve. If you don't know what to write about, just start writing. Write about anything that interests you, even if it's just your thoughts on the weather. The more you write, the more ideas you'll have, and the easier it will become to come up with new topics.

The second problem is a little trickier, but it's not insurmountable. The truth is, no one starts out with a huge audience. It takes time and effort to build a readership. But if you're willing to put in the work, you can do it.

So what are you waiting for? Start writing today! I promise you, I'll be one of your first readers. 

If you decide to start a blog in either English or Ukrainian, write something, [send it to me](mailto:vasilinavova@gmail.com), and I will read it and add your blog to my RSS reader.
