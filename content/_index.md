Hi, you've reached my personal corner of the Internet.

Working as a marketing analyst based in Kyiv, Ukraine, I love exploring different countries & cities, literature, and some quiet rest in the mountains. In my [blog](/blog/), I share thoughts and ideas about personal development, books, work, digital minimalism, and more.

If youâ€™d like to stay updated with my latest posts, you can join my [Telegram channel](https://t.me/vovavasylynablog) and subscribe for [the RSS feed](/blog/rss/).

Also see what I'm focusing on [now](/now/) and some of my favorite [bookmarks](/bookmarks/).
